# MammoScan AI ü©∫

[![CI](https://github.com/josephed37/mammoscan-AI/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/josephed37/mammoscan-AI/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

An AI-powered application for breast cancer detection from mammogram images, built with a high-performance Go backend and a Python-based machine learning pipeline. This project is being built in public to document the end-to-end process of creating a production-ready MLOps system.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Prediction:** Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images.
- **High-Performance API:** A backend written in Go for fast, low-latency inference.
- **Automated MLOps:** Features a full CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- **Zero-Cost Infrastructure:** Deployed entirely on the Google Cloud Platform free tier.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows a modern MLOps architecture, separating the ML training, backend serving, and frontend components into distinct, containerized services.
